                        <p>“She will go on and write her own book someday.”</p>

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>These were the words of my history teacher during a PTM with my parents when I was in Class
                            10. I remember quietly smiling because back then, that felt impossible. I was choosing
                            science. Writing was just something I loved, not something I believed I could pursue.</p>

                        <p>But as cliché as it sounds, what’s meant for you really does find you in ways you don’t
                            expect.</p>

                        <p>Writing found me again in Class 11, when I started freelancing purely for the love of it
                            without even knowing it could be commercialised. What began as passion slowly turned into
                            a fun, fulfilling business.</p>

                        <p>I joined LinkedIn only a few months ago, and I’ve genuinely loved the journey. The doors that
                            opened surprised me. Today, I work with TVM Creatives as a Content Writer & Strategist,
                            handling international clients and helping them generate leads.</p>

                        <p>Looking back, I realise: you don’t always have to abandon one path to find another.
                            Sometimes, passion quietly grows alongside you until one day, it becomes home.</p>
